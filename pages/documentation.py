<h2>1. Goal of the Project </h2>
'''
html_element_3='''
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The project focuses on leveraging prompt engineering for relation extraction in the context of sports players' biographies. The primary goal is to demonstrate how natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models can be utilized to extract meaningful relationships and entities from text, visualize these relationships, and provide insights into the biographies of sports players.</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Relation extraction is a pivotal task in NLP, enabling the identification of connections between entities within text. This project aspires to demonstrate how prompt engineeringâ€”specifically through few-shot methodology, can enhance the precision and efficiency of relation extraction. By doing so, it provides a potent instrument for deciphering complex information embedded within text, thereby facilitating the analysis and visualization of inter-entity relationships.</p>

<h2>2. Application Usage</h2>
<p><strong>Streamlit Interface: </strong> The application is constructed using Streamlit, offering an intuitive and interactive interface for user data input and result visualization.</p>
<p><strong>Input Player Name:</strong> Users are invited to input the name and surname of a sports player (e.g., Paulo Dybala) into the provided text field and submit the entry.</p>
<p><strong>Biography creation: </strong>The application employs an OpenAI language model to generate an extensive biography of the player based on few-shot prompting techniques. This generated text is subsequently processed using SpaCy for entity recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship Creation:</strong>The application constructs relationships between the recognized entities and stores them in a dataframe for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Graph Visualization:</strong>he relationships are visualized using NetworkX and PyVis, creating interactive graphs that depict the connections between entities.</p>
<p><strong>Community Detection:</strong>The application performs community detection to identify clusters of related entities, providing deeper insights into the structure of the relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis:</strong>: The application presents the extracted relationships and entities in various formats, including dataframes, line charts, and bar charts, to facilitate comprehensive analysis.</p>

<h2> 4. Project Summary: Web Mining and Retrieval for Relation Extraction in Sports</h2>
<p>This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and interactive data visualization tools to extract and visualize relationships between entities within textual descriptions of sports players. The primary objective is to utilize prompt engineering to generate comprehensive historical data for various athletes and represent the inter-relationships among entities in an engaging and informative manner.</p>
<p>This project demonstrates the powerful combination of NLP and data visualization in extracting and presenting complex relationships within text data. By offering an intuitive and interactive platform, it allows users to gain deep insights into the histories and connections of sports players, making it a valuable tool for sports analysts, enthusiasts, and researchers.</p>
